# NBA Draft Combine Measurements
Repository contains files related to the collection and analysis of NBA draft combine measurement data from Draft Express.

The difference between the `*_scrape.ipynb` and `*_multiscrape.ipynb` note is that the former only does one specific NBA draft combine year. You have to specify which year's draft combine you want to look at. The multiscrape notebook retrieves info for all of the years that DraftExpress has available.
